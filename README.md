# Skills Workspace

This repository is my local workspace for Codex skills and related references.

It is not a single-skill repo. It contains `doc-steward` today and is intended to include other
skills I use over time.

## What Lives Here

- Skill folders with a `SKILL.md` contract.
- Supporting references/templates used by those skills.
- Lightweight repo-level configuration for documentation quality.

## Current Skills

- `doc-steward`: documentation drafting, review, and maintenance workflows.

## Layout

```text
.
├── README.md
├── .markdownlint-cli2.yaml
├── doc-steward/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── PLAN.md
│   └── references/
└── ... (additional skills over time)
```

## Usage

- Run skills from this workspace during Codex sessions.
- Keep each skill self-contained with clear instructions and references.
- Add new skills as separate top-level folders following the same pattern.
