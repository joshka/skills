# README Template

Adapt sections as needed. Keep the top of the file focused and skimmable.

## Suggested Structure (General)

1. Project name + one-sentence summary
2. Screenshot/gif (optional, but helpful for TUI/UI projects)
3. Features (bulleted, user-facing)
4. Installation
5. Quick start (copy/paste, with expected output)
6. Usage / Examples
7. Configuration (env vars, config files, flags)
8. Compatibility (platforms, MSRV, terminal assumptions)
9. Troubleshooting / FAQ (top 3-5 issues)
10. Contributing / Development (optional)

## Greenfield Bootstrap Variant

Use this when docs do not exist yet:

1. What this project does (1-2 sentences)
1. Quick start (single happy path, copy/pasteable)
1. Expected success output
1. Required configuration (env vars/flags)
1. Common first-run failures and fixes

## Existing Project Upgrade Variant

Use this when README already exists but quality is mixed:

1. Preserve existing tone and vocabulary.
1. Remove drift (names, flags, defaults, behavior).
1. Improve navigation and section purpose statements.
1. Replace vague claims with evidence-backed statements.
1. Add missing operational/troubleshooting guidance.

## Quality Checks

- Every command is runnable as written.
- Examples match the current CLI/API names and defaults.
- The README answers: "What is it?", "Why use it?", "How do I start?", "What can go wrong?"
