# README Template

Adapt sections as needed. Keep the top of the file focused and skimmable.

## Suggested Structure

1. Project name + one-sentence summary
2. Screenshot/gif (optional, but helpful for TUI/UI projects)
3. Features (bulleted, user-facing)
4. Installation
5. Quick start (copy/paste, with expected output)
6. Usage / Examples
7. Configuration (env vars, config files, flags)
8. Compatibility (platforms, MSRV, terminal assumptions)
9. Troubleshooting / FAQ (top 3-5 issues)
10. Contributing / Development (optional)

## Quality Checks

- Every command is runnable as written.
- Examples match the current CLI/API names and defaults.
- The README answers: "What is it?", "Why use it?", "How do I start?", "What can go wrong?"
